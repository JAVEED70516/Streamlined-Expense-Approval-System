# Streamlined-Expense-Approval-System


Streamlined Expense Approval System

Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the workflow for employee expense request approvals within Salesforce. Employees will be able to submit expense requests, which will be routed to their managers for approval based on configurable thresholds. The workflow will include submission, multi-level approvals, and automated notifications to relevant stakeholders.

Problem Statement

Currently, employee expense request approvals are handled manually, leading to delays, errors, and lack of compliance with company policies. Managers must review expenses without automated checks for thresholds or business rules, which often results in inconsistent approvals and reduced process efficiency.
